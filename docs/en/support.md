The [issues list on GitHub](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/issues) is **not** the right place to ask for help. Use it to report bugs and to place feature requests. Questions like "how do I ..." or "I can't get this to work ..." should be directed to StackOverflow or esp8266.com.

Which ever site you use you need to make sure the description of the problem is to the point. It should be accompanied by a stripped down version of your Lua source code i.e. create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example (MCVE). A good resource is [http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

## Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow is the perfect place to ask coding questions. Use one or several of the following tags: [esp8266](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/esp8266), [nodemcu](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/nodemcu) or [Lua](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/lua).

## esp8266.com Forums
esp8266.com has a few [NodeMCU specific forums](http://www.esp8266.com/viewforum.php?f=17) where a number of our active community members tend to hang out.
